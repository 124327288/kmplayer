Changes since version 0.9.0-rc1
- Fix the broken recording from rc1 and possible some pre's too
- start and end with a simple smil document if started with no url.
  Can be turned off in rc file with option "No Intro=1" in section 
  "[General Options]".
- support Podcast rss urls, list chanel/item/enclosure tags and play url
  arguments of enclosure elements and display inner text from description
  in info window
- Added an info panel that is now implemented as a dockable view, this should
  become the infopanel for Real plugin's CONTROLS attribute possibility. Put
  messages from Xine backend in this window.
Changes since version 0.9.0-pre4
- In place renaming of TV channel/input names in playlist
- Added help sections for TV and VDR in handbook.
- TV settings are now stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/kmplayer/tv.xml. There is an
  automatic conversion. Should make manual changes more easy, see handbook for
  the format. Now also XVideo port and encoding can be configured, although
  manually only.
- More work on SMIL. Allow playing mediatype elements w/o having a region
  assigned, fixes audio only streams (eg. with the <audio> tag).
- Optionally use the expat SAX parser (instead of kmplayer's own one) when
  configured with --enable-expat. Note, the expat parser is more strict and
  therefor can misread some ASX files.
Changes since version 0.9.0-pre3
- Fix for DVD submenus for MPlayer and update regexp for audio/subtitle
  languages
- More work on SMIL. Show active SMIL element in playlist using the color
  settings. Like mediatypes, if set/animate elements have a duration than it
  should not deactivate itself immediately.
- Undo 'First jump to URL source page when opening an URL' from 0.8.1. Now the
  'Configure KMPlayer' option jumps to that page. File open, opens a file
  dialog again (and can select multible files)
- Allow opening multible files
- Support for gif movies in SMIL's 'img' element
- Regression fix plugin; when split over multible objects, the base url could
  be opened instead of the SRC url.
Changes since version 0.9.0-pre2
- Support javascript properties FileName and Volume
- Internal redesign of DOM classes
- Store current url in KDE's session config
- Added a 'Clear History' action, that will clear recent files and URL source
  history
- Delayed mouse hiding in fullscreen, patch from Ben Laenen
- Option for docking in system tray
- Smarter painting when moving regions in SMIL document
- More work on SMIL support. Implemented animate's 'values' attribute and
  'calcMode="discrete"'. Added 'fit' attribute for mediatypes (only used
  for images now, and value 'scroll' is not implemented). Group
  'excl' is now supported. Text elements are rendered by QTextEdit, so it
  supports html now too. Updated applications in tests/ directory
Changes since version 0.9.0-pre1
- Include tests directory
Changes since version 0.8.4b
- Build fix for compiling with -fvisibility=hidden
- More work on SMIL, support for layout/root-layout/region tags so one can
  position a mediatype in a rectangle, other than video/audio also support
  for text/img mediatypes and flow control with begin/dur/end attribute that
  can be time values but also (mouse) events or clip ends and set/animate can
  be used to alter arguments on-the-fly.
- Added option to adjust the colors of playlist and viewing area
- Added an option in playlist context menu to show all nodes in case of XML
  based playlists (ASX or SMIL)
- Added option whether backends should set volume on start
- Original gcc-2.95 compile fixes (Leo Savernik)
Changes since version 0.8.4a
- gcc-2.95 compile fixes (Leo Savernik) hopefully correctly backported
- Read playlist from audio/m3u mimetypes
- Don't print log to stdout but to stderr instead (BR100422)
- Don't set volume on starting MPlayer because MPlayer sets volume relative
  to current volume (BR99953)
Changes since version 0.8.4
- Fix keyboard shortcuts for increase/decrease volume for fullscreen
- Better 100% zoom calculation
- Prevents ways to crash KMPlayer via DCOP when just started

Changes since version 0.8.4-rc5
- Debian builds now a kmplayer-i18n package too
- Controlpanel uses paletteForegroundColor for drawing
- Added a volume control to controlpanel that let backends control the volume
  (unlike the slider in menu, which uses kmix) + two actions for shortcut
  possibility in 'Configure Shortcuts' dialog
- Bookmarking a VDR channel now bookmarks it as kmplayer://vdrsource/channel
- When controlpanel is in autohide mode, move it over the video instead of
  shifting the video up causing annoying flickering (bug 96861)
- up/down/ok/back/menu for VDR are added to the toolbar as well when connected
- Unmute DVB card when VDR reports volume of zero, restore on exit
- Auto scroll playlist when current is outside the viewing area
Changes since version 0.8.4-rc4
- Recording now stops movie playing after hitting 'Start Recording'
- Be less strict with parsing ASX (and SMIL) play list files
- Internals: merge code from backends, with the 'never reaching' goal to add
  a new backend just by configuration (plus a backend player of course)
- Internals: move playlist handling to Partbase, instead of each process have
  their own tricks. Also kxineplayer accepts '-vo x11' now, kgstreamer eats
  local url's w/o file:// prefix.
- Internals: re-implement backend XML config and TV config data using own
  DOM-like classes for no less reason than increasing the code coolness :-)
- Added view video/playlist/console to toolbar
- Playlist will default appear on top if there are only a few items
- TV inputs/channels are now displayed inside the playlist, instead of a menu
- kxvplayer also accounts for frequency setting when guessing the xvideo port,
  more usable for TV viewing
- Move all library classes to the KMPlayer namespace and strip the KMPlayer
  prefix in the name. Rename class KMPlayer itself to PartBase.
- Binary data detection when reading a playlist that turns out to be
  video/audio stream (instead of creating a playlist w/ wierd names)
Changes since version 0.8.4-rc3
- Look for title entries in ASX and .pls files for playlist items
- DemiBold font for playlist and console log window for readability
- Begin of GStreamer backend support, local file only
- Allow disconnect/connect for VDR while still playing, allows other apps to 
  access the VDR port
- Actively determine mime-type for playlist detection (was guess on extension
  or use the one the plugin got from konqueror)
- VCD tracks are, for MPlayer only, displayed in playlist and not in menu
- Added custom command for VDR, output to console view
- Made command interaction with VDR much more reliable
Changes since version 0.8.4-rc2
- Added a XVideo player (kxvplayer) process. Used now for viewing VDR
- Fixed various crash cases with the playlist
- Playlist view is dockable now
Changes since version 0.8.4-rc1
- Oops, left an ugly hack in the icon loading for the playlist tree, can crash
  konqueror.
- Some playlist tree visualization ordering fixes
Changes since version 0.8.3a
- Nice icons from Marcel Dierkes, thanks!!!
- Replaced internal playlist structure from std::list to DOM
- Removed the 'Show Console' option, now one can always switch to the console
  output window

- Comment out NoExpose debug line with kxineplayer
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc5
- Two more regression fixes in show cache progress, get rid of spurious seek
  command caused by switching progress slider usage and don't update playing
  position if there is no position change (might fill cache instead).
- Xinerama fix, fullscreen on display where video widget is on.
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc4
- Fix regression in show cache progress in 0.8.3-rc2, which made the xine
  backend hang on some web movies
- Ripped out the arts volume slider. Now you only get a volume slider if you
  run kmix standalone or as an applet in kicker.
- Try to limit symbols in the shared objects by using KDE_NO_EXPORT. Although
  hard to measure, hopefully speed up loading the plugin
- New recorder (mplayer -dumpstream) from Stefan Siegel
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc3a
- Downloading of .m3u/.pls also eats .asx, so try to read this one too. This
  fixes also MPlayer-1.0pre not been able to read .asx files.
- Make sure if we're downloading a playlist file, it isn't bigger than 50k
- More or less revert the alsa5/alsa9 change to just alsa. Seems latest
  MPlayer doesn't work with alsa5/alsa9. Although they are still available.
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc3
- add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE in configure.in.in, no recheck/automake/autoconf
  version mismatch
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc2
- All QtoolTips to QWhatsThis and help from Xine for whatsthis by xine options
- Store xine settings in ~/.kde/share/apps/kmplayer/xine_config and not in
  ~/.xine/config2. Save the first time if file does not exist (Automaticly
  sets the misc.memcpy_method).
- Added a debian build directory, builds a kmplayer-lib, kmplayer-plugin and a
  kmplayer-app package. Eg. install only kmplayer-lib and kmplayer-plugin if 
  you prefer another player but do want the plugin for konqueror.
- Added protocol files for mms://, rtsp:// and pnm://
- Position slider now also shows progress of the cache fill
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc1

  fullscreen and embedded part and show them otherwise
- Fix another case of video widget stays black cause in kxineplayer
- If position slider is hidden, make buttons small again (like <= 0.8.2)
- Support for AUTOSTART attribute

  pls' on http://www.shoutcast.com should work now
Changes since version 0.8.2
- fix for the "video window stays (sometimes/often) black" bug, which seems to
  occur more with the latest Qt versions. KMPlayer uses a XSimpleWindow now
  that is managed by QXEmbed
- Support for Real's CONTROLS/CONSOLE attributes. This makes it possible
  multible plugins cooperate with imagewindow/controlpanel
- Combine control buttons and position slider to one control panel
Changes since version 0.8.2-rc5

- MPlayer-1.0-pre is default now ([MPlayer] Post MPlayer 0.90=true in
  kmplayerrc)
- Removed the '-frames 0' switch for MPlayer-1.0-pre, now identifying is done
  in one stroke with playback (faster playing, less sensible to failures)
- Xine configuration tab for convenient editing of ~/.xine/config2
- Made config dialog somewhat flexible, and TV/broadcast settings are now
  not available when launched from the plugin
- Change dir of mplayer/kxineplayer process if playing a local file. Hopefully
  fixes relative links in supported playlist files.
- Profiles for broadcasting

Changes since version 0.7.96
- Build changes, kdeinit wasn't used (speeds up loading) and an option for
  disabling arts volume slider (eg. if you use kmix already)
  use --disable-arts-volume with configure and it prevents linking agains the 
  arts libs (speeds up loading of kmplayer too)
- Moved color sliders to a sub menu, fix it for mplayer

- Also enable DVD playing using kxineplayer (dvdnav, yeah!)
Changes since version 0.7.4c
- Added a simple Xine player backend (kxineplayer). Basically a finger practice
  for the upcoming MPlayer-G2 lib, but now quite useful for rtsp/real playback.
  Works only for URLs
