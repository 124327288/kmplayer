The core of kmplayer is in kmplayerpartbase.x. PartBase keeps
the list of Source objects (dvd/vcd/url/..) and Process objects
(mplayer/xine/gst/xv), controls the View or respond to its signals. Both
application as kpart (for plugin) has one PartBase. However, in case of
plugin for khtml, it's possible one PartBase controls multible View
objects (see tests/controls.html).

The View is the parent of ViewArea, PlayList and InfoWindow. ViewArea is
the parent of Viewer (the output for the backend players) and
ControlPanel.
In case of smil animations, the Viewer widget can be hidden or made
smaller so ViewArea background is where the rendering is done.
What should be done is moving the code for PlayList to
kmplayerplaylistview.x from kmplayerview.x.
Classes in kmplayerplaylist.x are actually base for the XML playlist
formats (smil/asx/rss/..).

There is always one Source object active. A Source object sets up the
interface to the user, as far possible, handling playlists and launching
backends. This is not fully worked out yet, eg. URLSource should be able
to launch multible backends for smil.

Backends are instances of Process and should become more simple, just 
passing data from/to external processes. A Recorder object is also a
Process.

KMPlayerPart and KMPlayerApp are classes that use the above for plugin
and application.

Finally there is also a Settings class for general usage and for
launching the configure dialog.
